# Recipe App in Kotlin

I’m excited to share my latest Android project—**a Recipe App** built in Kotlin! This app allows users to explore, save, and view their favorite recipes. Some of the key features include:

- 🍴 **Recipe Search**: Fetches recipes based on categories, random selections, and more.
- 💾 **Favorite Recipes**: Stores user’s favorite recipes using **Room Database**.
- 🧑‍🍳 **MVVM Architecture**: Clean architecture for better separation of concerns and maintainability.
- 🔌 **Retrofit Integration**: Fetches recipes data from an external API with ease.
- 📱 **Modern UI/UX**: Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.

This project helped me enhance my skills in Android development while learning about **MVVM architecture**, **Retrofit**, and **Room Database**.
